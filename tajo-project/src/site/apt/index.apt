Apache Tajo&#153;: A big data warehouse system on Hadoop

  Apache Tajo is a robust big data relational and distributed data warehouse system for Apache Hadoop.
  Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc queries, online aggregation,
  and ETL (extract-transform-load process) on large-data sets stored on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
  and other data sources. By supporting SQL standards and leveraging advanced database techniques,
  Tajo allows direct control of distributed execution and data flow across a variety of query evaluation
  strategies and optimization opportunities.

Features

  * <<Fast and Efficient>>

    * Fully distributed SQL query processing engine

    * Advanced Query Optimization such as cost-based and progressive query optimization

    * Interactive analysis on reasonable data set

  * <<Scalable>>

    * Fault tolerance and dynamic scheduling for long-running queries

    * Out-of-core algorithms for data sets larger than main memory

  * <<Compatible>>

    * ANSI/ISO SQL standard compliance

    * Hive MetaStore access support

    * JDBC driver support

    * Various file formats support, such as CSV, JSON, RCFile, SequenceFile and Parquet

  * <<Easy>>

    * User-defined functions

    * Interactive shell

    * Convenient Backup/Restore utility

    * Asynchronous/Synchronous Java API
