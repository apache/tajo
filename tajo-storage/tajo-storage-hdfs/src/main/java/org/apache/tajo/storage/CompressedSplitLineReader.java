/**
 * Line reader for compressed splits
 *
 * Reading records from a compressed split is tricky, as the
 * LineRecordReader is using the reported compressed input stream
 * position directly to determine when a split has ended.  In addition the
 * compressed input stream is usually faking the actual byte position, often
 * updating it only after the first compressed block after the split is
 * accessed.
 *
 * Depending upon where the last compressed block of the split ends relative
 * to the record delimiters it can be easy to accidentally drop the last
 * record or duplicate the last record between this split and the next.
 *
 * Split end scenarios:
 *
 * 1) Last block of split ends in the middle of a record
 *      Nothing special that needs to be done here, since the compressed input
 *      stream will report a position after the split end once the record
 *      is fully read.  The consumer of the next split will discard the
 *      partial record at the start of the split normally, and no data is lost
 *      or duplicated between the splits.
 *
 * 2) Last block of split ends in the middle of a delimiter
 *      The line reader will continue to consume bytes into the next block to
 *      locate the end of the delimiter.  If a custom delimiter is being used
 *      then the next record must be read by this split or it will be dropped.
 *      The consumer of the next split will not recognize the partial
 *      delimiter at the beginning of its split and will discard it along with
 *      the next record.
 *
 *      However for the default delimiter processing there is a special case
 *      because CR, LF, and CRLF are all valid record delimiters.  If the
 *      block ends with a CR then the reader must peek at the next byte to see
 *      if it is an LF and therefore part of the same record delimiter.
 *      Peeking at the next byte is an access to the next block and triggers
 *      the stream to report the end of the split.  There are two cases based
 *      on the next byte:
 *
 *      A) The next byte is LF
 *           The split needs to end after the current record is returned.  The
 *           consumer of the next split will discard the first record, which
 *           is degenerate since LF is itself a delimiter, and start consuming
 *           records after that byte.  If the current split tries to read
 *           another record then the record will be duplicated between splits.
 *
 *      B) The next byte is not LF
 *           The current record will be returned but the stream will report
 *           the split has ended due to the peek into the next block.  If the
 *           next record is not read then it will be lost, as the consumer of
 *           the next split will discard it before processing subsequent
 *           records.  Therefore the next record beyond the reported split end
 *           must be consumed by this split to avoid data loss.
 *
 * 3) Last block of split ends at the beginning of a delimiter
 *      This is equivalent to case 1, as the reader will consume bytes into
 *      the next block and trigger the end of the split.  No further records
 *      should be read as the consumer of the next split will discard the
 *      (degenerate) record at the beginning of its split.
 *
 * 4) Last block of split ends at the end of a delimiter
 *      Nothing special needs to be done here. The reader will not start
 *      examining the bytes into the next block until the next record is read,
 *      so the stream will not report the end of the split just yet.  Once the
 *      next record is read then the next block will be accessed and the
 *      stream will indicate the end of the split.  The consumer of the next
 *      split will correctly discard the first record of its split, and no
 *      data is lost or duplicated.
 *
 *      If the default delimiter is used and the block ends at a CR then this
 *      is treated as case 2 since the reader does not yet know without
 *      looking at subsequent bytes whether the delimiter has ended.
 *
 * NOTE: It is assumed that compressed input streams *never* return bytes from
 *       multiple compressed blocks from a single read.  Failure to do so will
 *       violate the buffering performed by this class, as it will access
 *       bytes into the next block after the split before returning all of the
 *       records from the previous block.
