========================
Tajo is a relational and distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop.
Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc queries, online
aggregation and ETL on large-data sets by leveraging advanced database
techniques. It supports SQL standards. It has its own query engine which
allows direct control of distributed execution and data flow. As a result,
Tajo has a variety of query evaluation strategies and more optimization
opportunities. In addition, Tajo will have a native columnar execution and
and its optimizer.
