Table Partitioning
******************

Table partitioning provides two benefits: easy table management and data pruning by partition keys. Apache Tajo provides the column table partition which is supported for multiple columns in a table. In Tajo, partitioning is supported for both managed and external tables in the table definition. And the column table partition is designed to support the partition of Apache Hiveâ„¢.
