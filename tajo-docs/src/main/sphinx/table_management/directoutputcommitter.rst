Direct Output Committer
***********

The final output of a Tajo query is written to a location in S3 or HDFS. However, each task that is supposed to write the output data into a final location first writes it into a temporary location. It is in a taskâ€™s commit phase, when the output data is moved from the temporary location to a final location.

DirectOutputCommitter is a setting, which when enabled lets a task write the output data directly to the final location. In this case, a commit phase just will backup previous output data. Setting DirectOutputCommitter avoids Eventual Consistency issues and its default value is false.
